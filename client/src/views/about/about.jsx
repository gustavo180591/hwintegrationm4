      <h2>Hola! soy Gama! Fullstack Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m an IT enthusiast with a strong focus on back & fullstack
        development. I consider my self to be a responsible hard working person
        always eager to learn and grow, because of this I decided to step in the
        IT world by studying at Henry bootcamp which gave me the tools to start
        my journey . As a part of my formation I've worked on personal projects
        created with the premise of delivering a fully functional and
        entertaining user interface using the latest technologies to test my
        skills and expand my knowledge.{" "}
